Plugin generates not one but two, highly customizable Google News Editors’ Picks RSS Feeds. Increase your news site traffic with featured content on Google News!

== Description ==

The most comprehensive RSS feed generator specifically tailored to meet the needs of publishers wanting to optimize an individual Google News Editors’ Picks RSS Feed. Creates both a homepage and section-based feed topic-specific. 
Customize required feed images, names, titles, descriptions and more! Exclude articles from feeds and enter custom meta descriptions from the lightweight, custom meta box located on post.php (edit) screens.
In order to have your website included in Google News, you will have to [suggest it for inclusion](https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/40787?hl=en) first. This plugin is nearly pointless without site inclusion.
Serious news sites should consider upgrading to the [WordPress Google News Plugin](http://www.googlenewsplugin.com) to take advantage of all tools available to Google News Publishers and optimize their site for Google News.

* Post to Article Label conversion 

What is the Post to Article Label conversion add-on? WordPress is tailored to blogs even after all these years. News organizations publish "Articles," not "Posts." Schema relies on "Article" markup, not "Post" markup. So, we should, too. The conversion will change the label on the WP dashboard and output to Article(s), without destroying past projects.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are my custom Google News Editors’ Picks RSS feeds giving me a 404 error? =

If no feed appears when you click on the “View RSS Feed” button, which will give you a 404 error, then go to “Permalinks” under “Settings” in the left-hand side WP column, and click “Save Settings” to generate your custom RSS feeds. Return to the Editors’ Picks admin page and once again click on the “View RSS Feed” button. You will now see your feed.

For more information on how to set up your custom Editors’ Picks, read the [following feed tutorial](http://bit.ly/YMGVof).

= Will I lose settings or data if I update to the Premium WordPress Google News Plugin? =

Good news! No. Without getting into the weeds, if you follow the instructions (i.e. deactivate feeds plugin first) the premium version will use the same database table and settings.
